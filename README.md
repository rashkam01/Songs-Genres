Prediction and Classification of Songs in Genres
A Comparison of SVM, Logistic Regression and RandomForest Classifiers for Genre Multi-class Classification
Abstract
This report presents and compares the performance of three approaches for music genre classification which are widely being used. The proposed techniques consists of feature engineering stage followed by classification stage which compares different parameters set for the classifer. Music genre classification is an important task and it finds its application in many tasks like in programs making cocktails that matches the music, generating dynamically images that matches music [2]. There are 10 genres present in the data and SVM[3], logistic regression[4] and RandomForest classifiers[5] are tested for ability to classify the songs in these 10 genres. In the first part, multi-classification is tested with accuracy measure and in the second part one vs rest classification is applied where algorithms are compared on the basis of log loss. The results showed that SVM with kernel as 'rbf' performed the best in the first and RandomForest classifier performed the best when one vs rest classification method was used.

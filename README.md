## Prediction and Classification of Songs in Genres 
The data analysis project involves the design of a complete machine learning solution. In
particular, the project revolves around the task of identifying the music genre of songs. This
is useful as a way to group music into categories that can be later used for recommendation
or discovery. 

## The Data 
The data is split into two datasets: a training data set with 4363 songs, and a test set dataset
with 6544 songs. Each song has 264 features, and there are 10 possible classes in total.
The dataset is a custom subset of the Million Song Dataset, and the labels were obtained
from AllMusic.com.
